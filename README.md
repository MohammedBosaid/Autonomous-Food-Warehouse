# Autonomous Food Warehouse — Full Robotic Conversion Blueprint

This repository contains a complete engineering proposal to convert a traditional food warehouse into a fully autonomous operation. The system architecture eliminates the need for human involvement at every stage—from inbound logistics to final dispatch—while maintaining full compliance with food safety standards and operational efficiency requirements.

## Objective

Design and deploy a scalable robotic system that:
- Handles dry, refrigerated, and frozen goods across dynamic storage environments
- Executes fully automated workflows including receiving, sorting, storage, picking, packing, and shipping
- Integrates predictive maintenance, real-time tracking, and adaptive control algorithms
- Achieves precision handling under strict spatial and environmental constraints

## Contents

- Automation algorithm design (nine-stage operational flow)
- System components: AGVs, AMRs, AS/RS units, robotic arms, and vision systems
- Environmental and safety considerations for food-grade operation
- Technical specifications for robotic reach, payload, speed, and navigation
- Emergency response and fault tolerance design

## Working Envelopes

All robotic systems were dimensioned and specified to ensure interoperability, vertical access, and cold-zone compatibility across a multi-level warehouse structure.

## Deliverables

The full blueprint is documented in the following PDF:

## Use Cases

- Robotics architecture for food logistics  
- Warehouse automation R&D  
- Final-year engineering capstone design  
- Early-stage prototypes for autonomous industrial operations
